# scuffed-driver-station
i wanted a thing that i could do when i am too dead from frc cadding (although this is part of frc) 

# session 1:
needed a short break from cadding up a robot, so i decided to do this. 
first thing i need are driver station dimensions.

this is the space that i think i'll use, some space for stuff like chargers and fancy things.

this is like the approximate size of a laptop (well, my own laptop with like 50mm of tolerances.)

i don't know what you can store in here that's good for frc except chargers and maybe controllers, but yeah, storage !!!
ok so i realised that i probably don't need that much storage, so uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
anyways. 
i think i might make handles.
